# WTC2015-Notifications-Demo
Code as used in the "The Wearable Device Etiquette of Notifications" talk at Wearables TechCon 2015 (Steve Penna &amp; Heiko Behrens)

This example creates two notifications (one for each button). The first is a simple single message with both phone and wearable actions.

The second message is a group summary, which does not have actions on the phone. On the wearable, this message also appears as a group summary - which is not a good experience ("You have 2 new messages")

See the branch "sidechannel" for an example of to add sidechannel notifications for a better experience on Wearable devices (the 2nd message is shown in full on the Pebble, and has werable actions)
